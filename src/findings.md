- No unused variable. If required, prefix with an underscore
- enums have implicit values - zero-indexed
- const cannot be modified, only static(which is considered unsafe)
- There is safety in static typing but the compiler can infer if bindings are not annotated
- variable bindings are immutable except by the `mut` keyword
- variable binding can be shadowed using `let`
- data is frozen when bound immutably until the immutable binding(shadowing) goes out of scope
- type aliasing can help give a really long variable name a temp short one
- The From trait can give the Into trait but the Into trait does not give the From trait
- No assigning when borrowing is in play
- Use label in nesting loops so that `break` and `continue` can refer to which loop
- Loop can rerturn a value if the value is put after `break`
